Let’s say you have two SQL tables: authors and books.
The authors dataset has 1M+ rows; here’s the first six rows:
    
    AUTHORS TABLE

author_name	book_name
author_1	book_1
author_1	book_2
author_2	book_3
author_2	book_4
author_2	book_5
author_3	book_6

The books dataset also has 1M+ rows and here’s the first six:
    
    BOOKS TABLE

book_name  sold_copies
book_1	   1000
book_2	   1500
book_3	   34000
book_4	   29000

You work for a startup that makes an online presentation software. You have an event log 
that records every time a user inserted an image into a presentation. 
(One user can insert multiple images.) The event_log SQL table looks like this:
    
    PRESENTATION TABLE

user_id	event_date_time
7494212	1535308430
7494212	1535308433

6946725	1535308476
6946725	1535308477
…	…
…and it has over one billion rows.
Note: If the event_date_time column’s format doesn’t look familiar, google “epoch timestamp”!

Write an SQL query to find out how many users inserted more than 1000 but less than 2000 images
 in their presentations!

You have two SQL tables! The first one is called employees and it contains the employee names, 
the unique employee ids and the department names of a company. Sample:

             Employees
department_name     	employee_id	           employee_name
Sales	                  123	                John Doe
Sales	                  211	                Jane Smith
HR	                      556	                Billy Bob
Sales	                  711	                Robert Hayek
Marketing	              235	                Edward Jorgson
Marketing	              236	                Christine Packard
…	…	…
The second one is named salaries. It holds the same employee names and the same employee ids – and the salaries for each employee. Sample:
          Salaries
salary	              employee_id	                      employee_name
500	                     123	                           John Doe
600	                     211	                           Jane Smith
1000	                 556	                           Billy Bob
400	                     711	                           Robert Hayek
1200	                 235	                           Edward Jorgson
200	                     236	                           Christine Packard
…	…	…
The company has 546 employees, so both tables have 546 rows.

Print every department where the average salary per employee is lower than $500!
